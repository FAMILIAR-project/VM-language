Descriptions:

feat manifest is "It presents essential information about the App to the Android system before running any of the app's code" 
att manifest._package is "A full Java-language-style package name for the application. Manifest._package should be manifest.package. "
att manifest.sharedUserId is "The name of a Linux user ID that will be shared with other applications."
att manifest.sharedUserLabel is "A user-readable label for the shared user ID. The label must be set as a reference to a string resource; it cannot be a raw string."
att manifest.versionName is "The version number shown to users." 
feat application is "The declaration of the application. This element contains sub-elements that declare each of the application's components and has attributes that can affect all the components. Many of these attributes (such as icon, label, permission, process, taskAffinity, and allowTaskReparenting) set default values for corresponding attributes of the component elements. Others (such as debuggable, enabled, description, and allowClearUserData) set values for the application as a whole and cannot be overridden by the components."
att application.allowTaskReparenting is "Whether or not activities that the application defines can move from the task that started them to the task they have an affinity for when that task is next brought to the front � ''true'' if they can move, and ''false'' if they must remain with the task where they started. The default value is ''false''.
The <activity> element has its own allowTaskReparenting attribute that can override the value set here. See that attribute for more information."
att application.allowBackup is "Whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and restore infrastructure. If this attribute is set to false, no backup or restore of the application will ever be performed, even by a full-system backup that would otherwise cause all application data to be saved via adb. The default value of this attribute is true."
att application.backupAgent is "The name of the class that implement's the application's backup agent, a subclass of BackupAgent. The attribute value should be a fully qualified class name (such as, 'com.example.project.MyBackupAgent'). However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a period (for example, '.MyBackupAgent'), it is appended to the package name specified in the <manifest> element.
There is no default. The name must be specified."
att application.debuggable is "Whether or not the application can be debugged, even when running on a device in user mode � 'true' if it can be, and 'false' if not. The default value is 'false'."
att application.description is "User-readable text about the application, longer and more descriptive than the application label. The value must be set as a reference to a string resource. Unlike the label, it cannot be a raw string. There is no default value."
att application.enabled is "Whether or not the Android system can instantiate components of the application � 'true' if it can, and 'false' if not. If the value is 'true', each component's enabled attribute determines whether that component is enabled or not. If the value is 'false', it overrides the component-specific values; all components are disabled.
The default value is 'true'."
att application.hasCode is "Whether or not the application contains any code  'true' if it does, and 'false' if not. When the value is 'false', the system does not try to load any application code when launching components. The default value is 'true'.
An application would not have any code of its own only if it's using nothing but built-in component classes, such as an activity that uses the AliasActivity class, a rare occurrence."
att application.hardwareAccelerated is "Whether or not hardware-accelerated rendering should be enabled for all activities and views in this application � 'true' if it should be enabled, and 'false' if not. The default value is 'true' if you've set either minSdkVersion or targetSdkVersion to '14' or higher; otherwise, it's 'false'.
Starting from Android 3.0 (API level 11), a hardware-accelerated OpenGL renderer is available to applications, to improve performance for many common 2D graphics operations. When the hardware-accelerated renderer is enabled, most operations in Canvas, Paint, Xfermode, ColorFilter, Shader, and Camera are accelerated. This results in smoother animations, smoother scrolling, and improved responsiveness overall, even for applications that do not explicitly make use the framework's OpenGL libraries.
Note that not all of the OpenGL 2D operations are accelerated. If you enable the hardware-accelerated renderer, test your application to ensure that it can make use of the renderer without errors.
For more information, read the Hardware Acceleration guide."
att application.icon is "An icon for the application as whole, and the default icon for each of the application's components. See the individual icon attributes for <activity>, <activity-alias>, <service>, <receiver>, and <provider> elements.
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image (for example '@drawable/icon'). There is no default icon."
att application.killAfterRestore is "Whether the application in question should be terminated after its settings have been restored during a full-system restore operation. Single-package restore operations will never cause the application to be shut down. Full-system restore operations typically only occur once, when the phone is first set up. Third-party applications will not normally need to use this attribute.
The default is true, which means that after the application has finished processing its data during a full-system restore, it will be terminated."
att application.largeHeap is "Whether your application's processes should be created with a large Dalvik heap. This applies to all processes created for the application. It only applies to the first application loaded into a process; if you're using a shared user ID to allow multiple applications to use a process, they all must use this option consistently or they will have unpredictable results.
Most apps should not need this and should instead focus on reducing their overall memory usage for improved performance. Enabling this also does not guarantee a fixed increase in available memory, because some devices are constrained by their total available memory.
To query the available memory size at runtime, use the methods getMemoryClass() or getLargeMemoryClass()."
att application.label is "A user-readable label for the application as a whole, and a default label for each of the application's components. See the individual label attributes for <activity>, <activity-alias>, <service>, <receiver>, and <provider> elements.
The label should be set as a reference to a string resource, so that it can be localized like other strings in the user interface. However, as a convenience while you're developing the application, it can also be set as a raw string."
att application.logo is "A logo for the application as whole, and the default logo for activities.
This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource containing the image (for example '@drawable/logo'). There is no default logo."
att application.manageSpaceActivity is "The fully qualified name of an Activity subclass that the system can launch to let users manage the memory occupied by the application on the device. The activity should also be declared with an <activity> element."
att application.name is "The fully qualified name of an Application subclass implemented for the application. When the application process is started, this class is instantiated before any of the application's components.
The subclass is optional; most applications won't need one. In the absence of a subclass, Android uses an instance of the base Application class."
att application.permission is "The name of a permission that clients must have in order to interact with the application. This attribute is a convenient way to set a permission that applies to all of the application's components. It can be overwritten by setting the permission attributes of individual components.
For more information on permissions, see the Permissions section in the introduction and another document, Security and Permissions."
att application.persistent is "Whether or not the application should remain running at all times � 'true' if it should, and 'false' if not. The default value is 'false'. Applications should not normally set this flag; persistence mode is intended only for certain system applications."
att application.process is "The name of a process where all components of the application should run. Each component can override this default by setting its own process attribute.
By default, Android creates a process for an application when the first of its components needs to run. All components then run in that process. The name of the default process matches the package name set by the <manifest> element.
By setting this attribute to a process name that's shared with another application, you can arrange for components of both applications to run in the same process � but only if the two applications also share a user ID and be signed with the same certificate.
If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (':'), a new process, private to the application, is created when it's needed. If the process name begins with a lowercase character, a global process of that name is created. A global process can be shared with other applications, reducing resource usage."
att application.restoreAnyVersion is "Indicates that the application is prepared to attempt a restore of any backed-up data set, even if the backup was stored by a newer version of the application than is currently installed on the device. Setting this attribute to true will permit the Backup Manager to attempt restore even when a version mismatch suggests that the data are incompatible. Use with caution!
The default value of this attribute is false."
att application.requiredAccountType is "Specifies the account type required by the application in order to function. If your app requires an Account, the value for this attribute must correspond to the account authenticator type used by your app (as defined by AuthenticatorDescription), such as 'com.google'.
The default value is null and indicates that the application can work without any accounts.
Because restricted profiles currently cannot add accounts, specifying this attribute makes your app unavailable from a restricted profile unless you also declare restrictedAccountType with the same value.
Caution: If the account data may reveal personally identifiable information, it's important that you declare this attribute and leave restrictedAccountType null, so that restricted profiles cannot use your app to access personal information that belongs to the owner user.
This attribute was added in API level 18."
att application.restrictedAccountType is "Specifies the account type required by this application and indicates that restricted profiles are allowed to access such accounts that belong to the owner user. If your app requires an Account and restricted profiles are allowed to access the primary user's accounts, the value for this attribute must correspond to the account authenticator type used by your app (as defined by AuthenticatorDescription), such as 'com.google'.
The default value is null and indicates that the application can work without any accounts.
Caution: Specifying this attribute allows restricted profiles to use your app with accounts that belong to the owner user, which may reveal personally identifiable information. If the account may reveal personal details, you should not use this attribute and you should instead declare the requiredAccountType attribute to make your app unavailable to restricted profiles.
This attribute was added in API level 18."
att application.supportsRtl is "Declares whether your application is willing to support right-to-left (RTL) layouts.
If set to true and targetSdkVersion is set to 17 or higher, various RTL APIs will be activated and used by the system so your app can display RTL layouts. If set to false or if targetSdkVersion is set to 16 or lower, the RTL APIs will be ignored or will have no effect and your app will behave the same regardless of the layout direction associated to the user's Locale choice (your layouts will always be left-to-right)."
att application.taskAffinity is "An affinity name that applies to all activities within the application, except for those that set a different affinity with their own taskAffinity attributes. See that attribute for more information.
By default, all activities within an application share the same affinity. The name of that affinity is the same as the package name set by the <manifest> element."
att application.testOnly is "Indicates whether this application is only for testing purposes. For example, it may expose functionality or data outside of itself that would cause a security hole, but is useful for testing. This kind of application can be installed only through adb."
att application.theme is "A reference to a style resource defining a default theme for all activities in the application. Individual activities can override the default by setting their own theme attributes. For more information, see the Styles and Themes developer guide."
att application.uiOptions is "Extra options for an activity's UI.
Must be one of the following values.
Value	Description
'none'	No extra UI options. This is the default.
'splitActionBarWhenNarrow'	Add a bar at the bottom of the screen to display action items in the ActionBar, when constrained for horizontal space (such as when in portrait mode on a handset). Instead of a small number of action items appearing in the action bar at the top of the screen, the action bar is split into the top navigation section and the bottom bar for action items. This ensures a reasonable amount of space is made available not only for the action items, but also for navigation and title elements at the top. Menu items are not split across the two bars; they always appear together.
For more information about the action bar, see the Action Bar developer guide.
This attribute was added in API level 14."
att application.vmSafeMode is "Indicates whether the app would like the virtual machine (VM) to operate in safe mode. The default value is 'false'.
The default value of this attribute is false.
This attribute was added in API level 17."
att application.taskAffinity is "An affinity name that applies to all activities within the application, except for those that set a different affinity with their own taskAffinity attributes. See that attribute for more information.
By default, all activities within an application share the same affinity. The name of that affinity is the same as the package name set by the <manifest> element."
att application.testOnly is "Indicates whether this application is only for testing purposes. For example, it may expose functionality or data outside of itself that would cause a security hole, but is useful for testing. This kind of application can be installed only through adb."
att application.theme is "A reference to a style resource defining a default theme for all activities in the application. Individual activities can override the default by setting their own theme attributes. For more information, see the Styles and Themes developer guide."
att application.uiOptions is "Extra options for an activity's UI.
Must be one of the following values.

This attribute was added in API level 14."
att application.vmSafeMode is "Indicates whether the app would like the virtual machine (VM) to operate in safe mode. The default value is 'false'."
feat activity is "Declares an activity (an Activity subclass) that implements part of the application's visual user interface. All activities must be represented by <activity> elements in the manifest file. Any that are not declared there will not be seen by the system and will never be run."
att activity.allowEmbedded is "Indicate that the activity can be launched as the embedded child of another activity. Particularly in the case where the child lives in a container such as a Display owned by another activity. For example, activities that are used for Wear custom notifications must declare this so Wear can display the activity in it's context stream, which resides in another process.
The default value of this attribute is false."
att activity.allowTaskReparenting is "Whether or not the activity can move from the task that started it to the task it has an affinity for when that task is next brought to the front � 'true' if it can move, and 'false' if it must remain with the task where it started.
If this attribute is not set, the value set by the corresponding allowTaskReparenting attribute of the <application> element applies to the activity. The default value is 'false'."
